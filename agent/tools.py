"""The agent's tools. Part 1 of HANDOUT.md (and the descriptions are used again in Part 5).

YOU WRITE: safe_path, read_file, edit_file, run_tests, format_report, and the docstring of
each of the three tools you write.
GIVEN (do not change): ToolFailure, use_workspace, workspace, list_files, TOOLS.

A tool's docstring is its description. It is the only thing the model learns about the
tool, both in your own agent and through your MCP server, so write it for the model:
what the tool does, what each input means, what comes back, and its limits. list_files
below is an example of the style.

When a tool cannot do what was asked, raise ToolFailure with a message that teaches: say
what went wrong and what to do next. The model reads that message and decides again.
The exact messages the tests expect are given in the comments above each function.
